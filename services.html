            <p style="color: white;"> Our readings are flexible and totally guided by you. If you need some help
                narrowing down your options you have a few tools! First, you can set a topic at the beginning of your
                reading from a list of common topics, like love, or career. Once you’re in the reading, you can ask your
                reader for some insight on a specific situation in your life that you’re dealing with, and they can tell
                you how your chart, energy, or cards can reveal more insight or help you navigate your path through it.
